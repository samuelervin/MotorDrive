# Micropython DCMotor Project using an L298N motor driver

## L298N motor driver

- Common motor driver for many DC motor projects.
- Depending on the type it is capable of running two motor outputs.
- Capable of Pulse Width Modulation of the motor/s as well for speed control.
  
## ESP8266 NodeMCU - code works fine just have to use these pins

| Variable Name | Pin Number|
|-----|
| PIN1 | GPIO05 |
| PIN2 | GPIO04 |
| PWM  | GPIO13 |
